# HustleTheRussell

The Russell US Indexes, from mega cap to microcap, serve as leading benchmarks for institutional investors. The modular index construction allows investors to track current and historical market performance by specific market segment (large/mid/small/micro cap) or investment style (growth/value/defensive/dynamic). All sub-indexes roll up to the Russell 3000Â® Index. The Russell US Indexes can be used as performance benchmarks, or as the basis for index-linked products including index tracking funds, derivatives, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

In HussleTheRussell, we are analyzing the top 7 Russell indexes to determine how our models will perform compared to their perspective index. We have pulled data from Alpaca to get baseline data which we have used to model, test, and predict future returns. The following is what we discovered.

## Summary

Our analysis attemps to predict future performance of various equity market stylistic factors by analyzing historical return profiles of 7 Russell ETFs that comprise the entire spectrum of the US equity market. This analysis will also incorporate macroeconomic data points that will help us describe results and potential deviations in predicted relative returns.

> ## Backgound of the Russell:
>
>> Created in 1984, the Russell 2000 Index follows the performance of a group of roughly 2,000 small-cap stocks and is a common economic indicator for that segment of the U.S. market.
>>
>> The Russell 2000 is an important stock index because owning stocks of various sizes is a common way people diversify their investments. Other well-known indices, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, focus on large-cap stocks of well-established companies. But the Russell 2000 is a popular index for gauging returns on U.S. small-cap stocks.

The objective of Russell 2000: The Russell 2000 is an important stock index because owning stocks of various sizes is a common way people diversify their investments. Other well-known indices, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, focus on large-cap stocks of well-established companies.

Create a Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab Notebook, or Amazon SageMaker Notebook to prepare a training and testing dataset.


 Optionally, apply a dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the input features, or perform feature engineering to generate new features to train the model.


 Create one or more machine learning models.


 Fit the model(s) to the training data.


 Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.


 Show the predictions using a sample of new data. Compare the predictions if more than one model is used.


 Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team and for inclusion in your presentation and your repo's README.md file.


 Use one new machine learning library, machine learning model, or evaluation metric that hasn't been covered in class.


 Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your project. Be sure to include any usage instructions to set up and use the model.
