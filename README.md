# HustleTheRussell

The Russell US Indexes, from mega cap to microcap, serve as leading benchmarks for institutional investors. The modular index construction allows investors to track current and historical market performance by specific market segment (large/mid/small/micro cap) or investment style (growth/value/defensive/dynamic). All sub-indexes roll up to the Russell 3000Â® Index. The Russell US Indexes can be used as performance benchmarks, or as the basis for index-linked products including index tracking funds, derivatives, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).

In HussleTheRussell, we are analyzing the top 7 Russell indexes to determine how our models will perform compared to their perspective index. We have pulled data from Alpaca to get baseline data which we have used to model, test, and predict future returns. The following is what we discovered.

The HussleTheRussell team took two different approaches on this project. First, we used one regression model to review it's performance against multiple indices. Secondly, we used multiple models to review their performance against a single index.

>> Launched in 1984, the Russell 3000 Index is a capitalization-weighted stock market index that seeks to be a benchmark of the entire U.S. stock market. It measures the performance of the 3,000 largest publicly held companies incorporated in America as measured by total market capitalization and represents approximately 97% of the American public equity markets.

**Seven indices we chose to focus on:**

## Indices

![](figures/image.png)

Large Cap = large companies such as Apple, Microsoft, etc. (typically > $40-50B) <br>
Small Cap = smaller companies (typically less than $6-7B) <br>

Growth = higher PE ratios, earlier stage companies with more growth potential <br>
Value = lower PE ratios, higher book/value ratios, higher dividend yields (spend on dividends to keep investors interested given lower growth potential) <br>

![](figures/mc_all_performance.png)

**Over 5.5 year period:** <br>
Significant outperformance of large cap stocks (especially growth) <br>
Growth stocks across cap rebounded better after recession due to injection of cash into markets and lower rates, creating an optimal situation for companies with higher levels of debt <br>

Using the logistic regression and predicted B/S signals, back-tested trading algorithms.

## Model Analysis Using IWV

In this part of the project, we will develop trading strategies using various machine learning algorithms. We use the IWV index as an example since it tracks the investment results of a broad-based index composed of U.S. equities. 

The input variables are the fast and slow simple moving averages (4 and 100 days, respectively). The target is the trading signal (1:buy, -1: sell) based on the actual return for each day. We split the data into training and testing samples. The input variables are normalized using StandardScaler. We considered seven machine learning models:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Gradient Boosting
* AdaBoost

After training the models on the training data, we evaluated the performance of each model on the testing data. This table summarizes the accuracy, precision and recall of each model:

| |Accuracy |Precision (-1) |Recall (-1) |Precision (1) |Recall (1)|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|Logistic Regression |0.531635 |0.452055 |0.058615 |0.536713 |0.938838|
|Support Vector Machines |0.540674 |0.833333 |0.008881 |0.539224 |0.998471|
|Decision Trees |0.534100 |0.444444 |0.028419 |0.536833 |0.969419|
|Random Forest |0.535744 |0.476190 |0.035524 |0.537872 |0.966361|
|K-Nearest Neighbor |0.537387 |0.500000 |0.039076 |0.538789 |0.966361|
|Gradient Boosting |0.534922 |0.451613 |0.024867 |0.537099 |0.974006|
|AdaBoost |0.537387 |0.500000 |0.021314 |0.538139 |0.981651|

This figure shows the accumulative returns using each model.

### Takeaways

The Support Vector machines model outperformed the actual returns over the time period, while the Logistic Regression model underperformed.  <br>

We see a lot of variability in the models that we tested. While the majority of our models outperformed the IWV, we see room for improvement. Overall, we did not predict selling signals with much accuracy. <br>

The precision of the Vector Machines model is much higher than other models. We believe this resulted in the model outperforming other models and the IWV. <br>

To expand on this project, we could have applied these models to additional indicies and then compared models accross those indicies.
